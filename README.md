An e-commerce website selling limited edition shoes. The working title for a shop name is called 'thenewsole' which sounds modern and contemporary.

This project is inspired by my husband's enthusiasm for buying and selling unique, timeless branded shoes.

Here's deployed heroku app - https://fg-proj4-the-new-sole.herokuapp.com/

## UX
 

#### RESEARCH
I interviewed my husband to know more about the quality, price of limited edition shoes. I asked him what his process is like in buying 'potential' shoes. Here's a list of questions


**What are the qualities of a sellable shoes (By order of importance)**
1. By model and design (eg. Jordan 1) (#1 in search engine)
2. By collaboration between shoe brands and artists (eg. off-white(Virgil Abloh) with nike, kanye west with adidas) (#3 in search engine)
3. Limited edition (shoes are not common to sell / 'hard-to-find')
4. Check the stock take (if there is stock available, its not sellable. if it's sold out or hard to add in cart, there's potential for high-sell)
5. By common asian size > (#2 in search engine)
6. By reseller's budget 


**List of websites he checks every 3 times a week**
- https://www.copgarden.com/
- https://www.adidas.com.sg/yeezy
- https://www.nike.com/
- https://stockx.com/


**What is your process in buying the shoes when there's an upcoming new release**
1. Checks the website for availability of that specific model
2. Selects the shoe size
3. Adds to cart (if it fails to add to cart, repeat this process)
4. Submit payment 


**Where do you sell these shoes?**
1. Carousell
2. Facebook Marketplace


**For ideas in creating wireframe for the 'kicks&sole' website, I did a simple hands-on test using [stocksx.com](https://stockx.com/) as my main reference with my husband. These are the directions / questions I asked him.**

<dl>
  <dt>Imagine you are about to buy a potential shoes, which part of the page do you first check?</dt>
  <dd> > Answer: I go to the popular release and click on the brand name</dd>

  <dt>Now that we are in the popular page, what do you do next?</dt>
  <dd> > Answer: I browse the page for the model I'm looking for</dd>

  <dt>When you see the model image, what's your next step?</dt>
  <dd> > Answer: I check for availability. If it's not available, I browse the other models</dd>

  <dt>Is there a way that you can reserve that model?</dt>
  <dd> > Answer: No, because this website don't allow you to do it. </dd>

  <dt>When you see that another model is available, what do you do? </dt>
  <dd> > Answer: I add it to cart. But there's a case that it is difficult to add it in due to high-demand so I have to be patient.</dd>

  <dt>I noticed that this other model with the same brand is available and easy to add to cart. Why is that?</dt>
  <dd> > Answer: Oh because the size is a smaller size and not that common. So the value may not be as high as I want to sell.</dd>

  <dt>How often do you visit this page?</dt>
  <dd> > Answer: It depends. If there's no new release coming up, I will check it once a week but if there's is, its 3x a week. </dd>

  <dt>Where do you hear the news about these new release?</dt>
  <dd> > Answer: Through facebook page or youtube shoe enthusiast. </dd>

The target users of this website will be:
- shoe enthusiast

1. **Specific buyer who buys for personal use or shoe reseller**
    - someone who is looking for specific model of a shoe brand
    - a registered user of the website who will be lead to 'login' page to access his profile
    - likes to check on reviews in 'review' section of the page

#### DESIGN

- I'm using **Abril Fatface** font by Google Fonts. I picked this for its contemporary style and bold type represents a strong emphasis on the webpage. This font is complemented by Open sans type which will be used for body text, prices, shoe models and reviews, 

- **Color** used will be black and white. I observed that most shoe websites have a plain background. This is to showcase the product details and design. 

- I'm taking a simple approach to this website to showcase more on the products.

- This will be mobile responsive which can be viewed in tablets and mobile phones as well. 



#### WIREFRAME

Here's the link to [desktop wireframe](https://www.figma.com/proto/UOeEbZ3kND6oXprh5DoQfc/theNewSole?node-id=4%3A677&viewport=-353%2C-728%2C0.31433194875717163&scaling=min-zoom)

## Features

    - **Login / Logout** - this is a compulsory for superuser to login in order to access the Admin page.

## Deployment

I used Gitpod as my main source of working on this project using a master branch. 

1. Created my github repository then worked on Gitpod as my main workspace while using a master branch. 

2. Used Django for rapid development. 
```
pip3 install django
```

3. During the process, this code is used for sanity check - HttpResponse and to make sure that all are up and running I used 8080 port to view my browser.

4. When adding new models or installing a user authentication, these codes are used to create tables and columns inside Django's database. This also applies when a model is modified. 
```
python3 manage.py makemigrations
```
```
python3 manage.py migrate
```

5. Used Cloudinary to upload images. 
```
pip3 install cloudinary
```
```
pip3 install python-dotenv
```
    - For Python configuration settings, a dotenv file is installed and imported in Django environment. A dotenv is used to store the cloudinary's Cloud name, API key and API secret keys. 
    - Dotenv is added to .gitignore file. 
    - For Cloudinary configuration, added cloudinary's os.environ in settings.py file. Next, registered Cloudinary by adding it in INSTALLED APPS.

6. Set up a User Authentication
```
pip3 install django-allauth
```
    - Added the Authentication backends in settings.py.
    - Defined a SITE_ID which will Allauth will need to identify.
    - Authentication Method, Email required, email verification, sign up email, username, login URL and login REDIRECT URL are added in after SITE_ID. 

7. Flash Messages 
    - Enabled messages in Django to activate flash messages. This is found in settings.py and added the MESSAGE_STORAGE code. 

8. Crispy Forms
    - For better form format, this is downloaded using css classes from Bootstrap. 
```
pip3 install django-crispy-forms
```

9. Used Stripes as online payment 
    - A dotenv is used to store the publishable, secret and webhook keys. 
    - A CSRF decorator is imported to provide protection against Cross
    
10. Deploying in Heroku
    - The following dependencies are installed 
```
pip3 install gunicorn 
pip3 install psycopg2 (this is used to install postgres)
pip3 install Pillow (this is installed for image processing)
pip3 install whitenoise 
pip3 install dj_database_url
```
    - Login to heroku 
    ```
    heroku login -i
    ```
    - Migrate all dotenv secret keys in Heroku website
    - Procfile is created 
    - In settings.py, under ALLOWED_HOST, the heroku link is added. 
    - To let Heroku know what packages are installed, a requirements.txt is generated. 
    ```
    pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
    ```
    - Set up Database from sqlite to postgres. Commented out the existing sql and migrated database to postgres.
    - Updated Webhook's API secret key to ensure Stripes work in heroku environment.

11. Set up email via GMAIL to ensure Allauth email validation works. Added HOST_PASS and USER and TEST_EMAIL into dotenv.
